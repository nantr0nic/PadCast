![PadCast v0.01](screenshots/padcast-v001.gif)

Work in progress! So far supports (any?) controller that matches the configuration
you see in the image above.

Written in C++ and is light on resources.

The images are .png files under /resources/ and can be edited to change the appearance of
the controller in the program.

The program will keep the same resolution between uses.
